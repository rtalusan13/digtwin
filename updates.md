## 7/30/25
- Miners work offline now
- Other QOL changes and edge case prevention
## 7/28/25
- Looking into the button highlighting issue, where the peach emoji can be clicked on and highlighted (possible solution?: png rather than text)
- Will further scale progression, price increase overlaps too early from one entity to the following one
- Also noticed how much empty space there is on desktop, would look to see if there can be any features added to desktop specifically as well as making mobile less compact
## 7/27/25
- Renamed "Upgrades" to "Entities" across all files, to make way for modifiers/upgrades that can be bought separate of entities
