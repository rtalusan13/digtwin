# DigTwin
sdiybt; cookie clicker game made with HTML & JavaScript | this project serves as my introduction into product and feature engineering, specifically for user-focused apps like games


## future ideas
will be adding more integrated imagery (spongebob pngs)
will also update graphics and create more gameplay progression and possibly a rebirth feature/something more creative
visual representation of owned upgrades, instead of numbers
include offline runtime capabilities
achievements?
update notes + reset progress buttons

modifiers: introducing a bar layout with square icons for upgrade that unlock (R to L pricing)

codes: codes to increase balance or entities
- also make it an on screen popup rather than dealing with the tab (same thing with offline calculation)

center + make update log button more visually appealing
