sdiybt; cookie clicker-esque game made with HTML


## future ideas
will be adding more integrated imagery (spongebob pngs)
will also update graphics and create more gameplay progression and possibly a rebirth feature/something more creative
visual representation of owned upgrades, instead of numbers
include offline runtime capabilities
achievements?
update notes + reset progress buttons

modifiers: introducing a bar layout with square icons for upgrade that unlock (R to L pricing)
